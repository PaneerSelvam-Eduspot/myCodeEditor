• Live preview using a sandboxed iframe

## Keyboard shortcuts

• Ctrl + Enter → Run code

• Ctrl + S → Save project

• Ctrl + J → Toggle output console

## Basic validation

• JavaScript syntax checks

• CSS brace warnings

• HTML tag mismatch warnings

• Project saving

• Save to localStorage

• Download and reload projects as JSON

• Output console

• Shows logs, warnings, and errors

• Clear logs anytime

## What I Learned

• How browser-based editors work internally

• Running user code safely using iframes

• Validating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without libraries

• Managing state with localStorage and JSON

• Structuring frontend code for clarity and maintainability

• Debugging real browser execution issues

• This project helped me move beyond tutorials and build something closer to real developer tools.
